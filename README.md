Immune Defense: A Tower Defense Game
Welcome to Immune Defense, a tower defense game I built using Python and Pygame. The game is themed around the human immune system, where you deploy immune cells like Neutrophils, Macrophages, and Helper T-Cells to fight off waves of pathogens such as Viruses, Bacteria, and Cancer cells. I created this project to showcase my Python programming skills, particularly in object-oriented design and game development.
Features

Thematic Gameplay: Use immune cells as towers, each with unique abilities like projectile attacks, AOE damage, or stat boosts.
Dynamic Waves: Enemies get tougher as you progress, with different types appearing in later waves.
Interactive Shop: Buy and place towers, and upgrade them as you earn resources.
Smooth Animations: Custom sprites and animations bring the game to life (all graphics were created by me).
Pause/Play: Easily pause and resume the game with a button.
